    "My friend, Anthony wants to open a fast food restaurant chain in New York City. He contacted me and asked my suggestions for starting the new business. His main problem is - what kind of customers he should focus on? For example - should his business target high income group, young aged group or high density area? What should be the price tier for his restaurant? Should it be uniform across places or differentiated based on some criterion? \n",

The solution to this problem is useful not only to the startups of restaurant business but similar approach can be adopted for any business which provides immovable service with limited reachability (like a furniture shop, electronics shop, grocery shop,<i> etc.</i>) to start up and analyse in advance how to maximize profit by opening shops/offices in the right place and targeting the right customers.

    "        Also due to limitation in data availability, the project focuses on those zipcodes for which demographic information are found.

    "        <br>\n",
    "        For example, demographic information also contained extra information like education, cost of living index, male to female ratio, etc. for each zip code. These columns were dropped to focus on income, age and population.\n",

    "        For certain restaurants, <b>Foursquare</b> misses information regarding ratings or price tier.\n",
    "        While price tier varies from 1 (cheap) to 4 (costly), ratings range from 1(poor) to 10(very good).\n",
    "        As part of data cleaning, the records with missing information were dropped so that the results are apparent.\n",
